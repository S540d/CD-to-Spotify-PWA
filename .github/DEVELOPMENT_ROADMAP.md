**Status:** Noch in Entwicklung - zu fr√ºh f√ºr Play Store Checkliste
**Timeline:** 12+ Wochen bis Play Store Registrierung (gesch√§tzt)
**Type:** PWA (React or Vanilla JS) mit Spotify API Integration
**Target Platform:** Web + Google Play Store (via Bubblewrap)

---

## üìÖ Development Phases (12+ Wochen)

### Phase 1: Core Development (Wochen 1-6)

**Ziel:** Implement alle Core Features & API Integration

#### Woche 1-2: Spotify API Setup & Authentication

**Spotify API Integration:**
- [ ] Register App auf Spotify Developer Dashboard
- [ ] Create Client ID & Client Secret
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 Flow
  - [ ] Authorization Code Flow (recommended f√ºr User Data)
  - [ ] Implement Login Button
  - [ ] Handle Redirect URI
  - [ ] Store Access/Refresh Tokens securely
  - [ ] Handle Token Refresh

**Authentication Security:**
- [ ] **WICHTIG:** Never store Client Secret in Frontend Code
  - [ ] Use Backend OAuth Proxy (recommended)
  - [ ] Or use Implicit Flow (legacy, less secure)
- [ ] Secure Token Storage:
  - [ ] Use httpOnly Cookies (wenn m√∂glich)
  - [ ] Or localStorage mit Vorsicht
  - [ ] Implement CSRF Protection
- [ ] Implement Logout/Token Revocation
- [ ] Handle Expired Tokens

**Example Architecture:**
```
Frontend (PWA)
  ‚Üì (sends auth code)
Backend (Your Server)
  ‚Üì (exchanges for tokens)
Spotify API
  ‚Üì (returns access token)
Backend
  ‚Üì (returns to frontend)
Frontend
```
