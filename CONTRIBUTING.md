## Coding Standards

### General Principles

- Follow the existing code style
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use TypeScript types (avoid `any`)

### Code Style

This project uses:

- **ESLint** for linting (run `npm run lint`)
- **TypeScript** strict mode
- **Prettier** formatting (auto-format on save recommended)

#### Key Conventions

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Descriptive names, typed
const handleAlbumScan = async (barcode: string): Promise<Album | null> => {
  // Implementation
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Unclear names, untyped
const handle = async (b: any) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

#### React Components

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Typed props, functional component
interface AlbumCardProps {
  album: Album;
  onPlay?: () => void;
}

export const AlbumCard: React.FC<AlbumCardProps> = ({ album, onPlay }) => {
  // Implementation
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Untyped props
export const AlbumCard = ({ album, onPlay }) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### File Organization

```
app/src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/       # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ barcode/     # Feature-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/          # Generic UI components (Button, Toast)

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # TypeScript type definitions

```
