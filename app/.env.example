# Spotify API Configuration
#
# Steps to get your Spotify Client ID:
# 1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
# 2. Log in with your Spotify account
# 3. Create a new app (name it "CD Collection to Playlist" or similar)
# 4. Copy the Client ID from your app settings
# 5. Add BOTH redirect URIs to your app settings:
#    - http://localhost:5173 (for local development)
#    - https://s540d.github.io/CD-to-Spotify-PWA (for production)
# 6. Save the settings in Spotify Dashboard
# 7. Paste your Client ID below
#

# Your Spotify Client ID (same for local and production)
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here

# Development (local)
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173

# Production (GitHub Pages) - uncomment and use this when building for production:
# VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://s540d.github.io/CD-to-Spotify-PWA
#
# Note: The app automatically uses the correct base path (/CD-to-Spotify-PWA/)
# for GitHub Pages when NODE_ENV=production
